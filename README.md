Input contact info (names and emails)

Created a simple program to let me type in names and emails, have the names automatically capitalized, and ensure no blank entries. The data is then saved to a CSV file which can be downloaded immediately after. Created this to assist a family member with a bunch of handwritten names and emails that were collected at an event.
